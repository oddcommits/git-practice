# Git Practice

Let's practice Git!

## Overview

This repository is designed to help newbies practice using Git and GitHub by creating a simple todo app. Each participant will check out their own branch from the main branch, where they will work on their respective todo app in a directory named after their own name. The directory will also contain [READMD.md](./JinChengQu/README.md) file to provide some information about themselves. Finally, each participant will add a link to their directory in [Contributors](#contributors) section of the root [README.md](#git-practice) file.
