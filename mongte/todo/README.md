   ## Introduction 'Todo App'

In this application, I’m going to create To-Do app using React JS using Typescript.

   ## Using description

- Before starting coding, you need to install Node.
- You can check if you have installed Node by running the command *node -v*.
- If you have already installed Node you will be getting a version as result.
- After installing the node you can create a ReactJS app using *npx create-react-app todo-app --template typescript*.
- Now here, you can use any name for your app. I’m using todo-app.
- Now we can start coding. Open the app directory in your code editor.
